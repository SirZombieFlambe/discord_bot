# discord_bot
This is the code behind my discord Bot JiggleBack!

If you would like to make your own discord bot using this code then Sweet!, just add in a "TOKEN_1.txt" file!

If you are wanting to use the random sound feature, make sure you change the directory where audio is stored.

If you want to use the feature where when certain people join the call it plays a random sound, or the feature where certain people are able to remotely start the bot
make sure you add a "sudoers_list.txt"!
